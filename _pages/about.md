__About me :__

I am interested in the biological and computational underpinning of learning and memory and how these mechanisms  enable the emergence of metarepresentation and more particularly metalearning.

I have a Phd in neurosciences, which was done in the Lyon Neurosciences Research Center, in the neuropop team under the supervision of Nathalie Mandairon and Anne Didier.
