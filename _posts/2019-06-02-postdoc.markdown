I started a postdoctoral position mid-april at New York University. I'm working on a project which is a collaboration between the Reyes lab in NYU and the Fusi lab in Columbia. The project is centered around understanding the mechanisms of learning and long-term memory using cortical cultures from mice and computational models.
